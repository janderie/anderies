summary: Governing Coupled Infrastructure Systems in Transition.
abstract: 'Governing the commons involves navigating the interplay between different types of infrastructure (natural, social, hard, soft, and human). The Coupled Infrastructure Systems (CIS) Framework was developed to study the role of institutional arrangements, political processes and human decision making in providing and managing shared infrastructures and has been applied to traditional natural commons (forests, irrigation systems, wildlife), but also the built environment (transportation, urban water, energy), and even the lunar surface.
This panel invites recent work of scholars using the CIS framework, especially in the context of transitions.'
