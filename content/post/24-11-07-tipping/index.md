"Tipping point" has become a popular metaphor for rapid, irreversible change. However, when used in the context of climate change policy, the term can be confusing and distract from urgent action, experts suggest in a recent article.

Expressions come and go in science. *Ecosystem Services* have given way, for example, to *Natures Contributions to People*.  These terms are shorthand for complicated relationships between people and nature. Both terms have problems (e.g. the role of human agency is obscured). Likewise, *tipping points* is shorthand for complex non-linear dynamics in which feedback structures change.  In a recent article, Kopp et al. (see link below) caution that the shorthand of *tipping point* is poorly defined and gives the illusion of scientific precision.  Further, the authors argue that the  *tipping point* framing does not provide a clear basis for climate action.  The authors call for much more careful communication around  and more specificity regarding the characteristics of *tipping points*.
