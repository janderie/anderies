Claudia is an environmental social scientist focusing on culturally mediated interactions between human systems and the environment. Previously, she examined artisanal fishers’ ecological knowledge in Costa Brava, Spain, focusing on local perceptions of and responses to climate change impacts in fishing communities. Her current research advances a cultural approach to climate change adaptation policy assessments—a perspective that is often overlooked but essential for effective adaptation. She employs a mixed-methods approach, integrating ethnographic research with computational modeling techniques.
