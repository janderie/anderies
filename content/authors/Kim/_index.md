Sola focuses on advancing human-AI interaction to tackle climate change by fostering mutual understanding and empathy. She explores how environmental justice intersects with human behavior, addressing polarization through participatory approaches. By designing tools for human-AI interaction, she leverages open and sustainable alternatives to cloud-based Large Language Models like ChatGPT, aiming to bridge gaps in environmental discourse, reduce polarization, and promote mutual learning through inclusive processes.
