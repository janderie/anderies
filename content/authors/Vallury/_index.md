Sechindra is a quantitative social scientist with policy-facing research on the political economy and distributional effects of climate adaptation in rural households. While his research is centered around agricultural development in South Asia, he also works across diverse resource systems in the U.S. and Europe, including pastoral, water, and energy systems. His work finds coherence through the common governance challenges and policy solutions that emerge across these different landscapes and geographical contexts.
